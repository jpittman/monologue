A demo to figuring out the correct user experience for composing a sequence of tweets.

## motivation

I've read a number of long threads on twitter and wonder how the author's went about composing their thoughts. It's one thing to write a short sequence of tweets (like 3-4), but when I see sequences of 30 tweets I have to wonder about the effort behind it.

So I wanted to write a tool to help solve that problem and give the user the maximum usability out of the experience.

## features

* Interface allows you to compose a series of tweets.
* You can see the tweets, reorder them, see stats like character counts for each posts.
* You can add images for each tweet, search services like GIPHY or imgur for content to add. 
* You can have hashtag templates to include. 
* When you publish these tweets, they will publish in sequence and will be a response to the previous tweet. They will time themselves so that they are appropriately distinct.
